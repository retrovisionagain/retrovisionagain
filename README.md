# âœ¨ Who am I?
I'm **Retro**.A regular application programmer, but with tendencies towards a systems programmer. I've been learning programming for 2 years now, I'm using Arch and yes, I wear stockings and write in Rust (joke). There are no repositories because what are they for? While others write a lot of information about themselves, I write almost nothing about myself.
